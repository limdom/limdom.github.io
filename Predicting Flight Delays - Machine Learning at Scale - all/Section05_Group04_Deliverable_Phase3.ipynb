The data covers flights from 2015 to 2021 and includes 109 features. The Flight Data provides us with the 2 potential response variables:\n\n- `DEP_DEL15` :  Classification of the flight being delayed by greater than 15 minutes\n- `DEP_DELAY`:  Minutes elapsed between Scheduled and Actual Departure Time\n\nThe dataset includes both numerical and categorical features that could be useful predictor variables. Numerical features include the time (`CRS_DEP_TIME`), date (`FL_DATE`) and distance flown for the flights. Categorical features such as Airline Carrier (`OP_CARRIER`), Plane Identifier (`TAIL_NUM`) are also of interest.\n\nWe conducted an exploratory data analysis of the 3-month sample flight dataset covering the 1st quarter of 2015 (2.8 million recorded flights). The EDA was conducted with a special focus on computing % of missing values per feature, understanding the distribution, scale and range of values of the features.\n\nAs a first step, we decided to drop any features with more than 50 percent of missing values from the dataset. The resulting dataset shrank the dimensions of the dataset from 109 features to 56 features. Of note, 49 of the dropped features were primarily related to flights diverted away from scheduled airports (99.74% missing values). We also decided to filter out cancelled flights that did not computed minutes in delay.\n\nTable 1 Missing Values from Flight Data\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1k8ZVVr6Rsmg6NRzcGDtqAssJ2fskefHk\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>\n\nFrom calculating the proportion of the Delayed and Not-Delayed classes from the predictor variable, `DEP_DEL15`, we observe that the majority of flights are classified as \"not delayed\". Our sample dataset corroborates our literature review that approximately 20% of all flights are delayed.\n\nTable 2 Proportion of Flights that are Delayed (≥ 15 minutes)\n\n|DEP_DEL15|cnt_per_group|perc_of_count_total|\n|---------|-------------|-------------------|\n|      0.0|      2166530|  79.58653046470691|\n|      1.0|       555702| 20.413469535293096|\n\nWe observe from the distribution of `DEP_DELAY` that amongst flights with delays, the majority of delays are less than 30 minutes. It is important to note that negative values are computed for flights that depart early than scheduled. \n\nFigure 1 Distribution of flight delays in minutes\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1yUw1L3z5efGxp6rv0lLNpIdR56Qk-9_7\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>\n\nAmongst the predictor variables in our dataset, we are particularly interested in the scheduled departure time (`DEP_TIME_BLK`), scheduled departure day of week (`DAY_OF_WEEK`), and Airlines Carrier (`OP_CARRIER`). We parsed the scheduled-departure hour of delayed flights and we observe that as the day progresses, the percentage of flights that are delayed steadily increase. We can speculate that there are network effects whereby earlier delayed flights affect later scheduled flight. This might be a result of delayed scheduled flights taking up Airport Terminal and Gate capacity.\n\nFigure 2 Distribution of flight delays by Scheduled Departure hour\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1D35X80alBoG3aM1N-TUi57aJBP1hSyp0\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=50%/>\n\nAs it relates to the day-of-the-week of scheduled flights, we observe upticks in flight delays as a % of total flights on Monday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday. This may be a result of increased  demand and stress on the Airline/Airport systems on days when passengers are more likely to be traveling for business (Monday - Thu/Friday) split and weekend travellers departing and returning from a trip (Friday/Sunday). \n\nFigure 3 Distribution of flight delays by \"Day of Week\"\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15-jlbGqaswTMHUNzD4K4Z5lEABZz9w4o\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>\n\nAirline Carrier is a notable categorical variable and is of particular interest. We can see a substantial range in flight timeliness performance by Airline Carrier. The worst performing Airline, Frontier Airlines (`F9`) is followed by Envoy Airlines/American Eagle (`MQ`) and JetBlue (`B6`). An interesting problem that we may need deal with is Airline Carriers that consolidate via mergers/acquisitions or are out of business.\n\nFigure 4 Distribution of flight delays by Airline Carrier\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Yl5G9j3wyYda_afJ1oZ65deSjDTZ9d4T\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"6c344bf7-f97b-40b2-bdf6-63888d66bc71","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["d\n\n#### Weather Data\n\nThe second data source is the Local Climatological Data (LCD) dataset from the National Centers for Environmental Information. The data covers the period from January 2015–December 2021). The LCD data contains summaries of climatological conditions from weather stations managed by the NWS, FAA, and DOD. Since the weather impacts airline flight operations, it is reasonable to assume that weather features may have predictive power in our model for flight delays.\n\nWe conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the weather set to spot anomalies, calculate the number of missing values, understand the distribution, scale, and range of values of the features, and propose how the features may have explanatory value for our model.\n\n The data includes hourly observations of temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed, barometric pressure, sky condition, visibility, and weather phenomena. These are critical observations of the atmosphere that help forecasters predict the weather.  \n\nWe reviewed the contents of the LCD dataset covering the period January-2015- December 2021. The observations correspond to 15079 weather stations. Overall the dataset contains 124 columns and approximately 900 million rows. We filtered the observations to include only weather stations located at airports in the US and territories. After this reduction, the dataset contained weather observations for 379 weather stations with 35 million rows and 26 columns.\n\nWe reviewed the contents of the weather observations to understand the contents, units of observation and report types. The dataset contained observations from seven differnt types of reports. Based on the report type, we decided to only allow observations from reports taken at hourly frequency (FM-15) and special weather reports (FM-16). This further reduced the nunber of rows to 31 million.\n\nWe estimated the number of missing values from any of the weather features in the model. Table 1 shows the dataset's features and the number of missing values. Table. shows the data types in the raw data. We reviewed each weather feature to assess their usefulness in explaining weather delays. THe pressence of many zeroes or missing values does not mean the feature has to be discarted.\n\n**Table 1 Missing Values from weather data** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1e2GVFKPLgwbTI_lvGByiqlcXYXqESSA9\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>\n\n**Table 2. Data dictionary from weather data after removal of features** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qIce1wYJ9ERAWB5ONOg94Hupx9MZHz9Z\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=30%/>\n\n\nWe want to use weather features that are typical causes for weather delays. According to the literature weather delays are related to the presence of thunderstorms, Ice, Freezing rain, snow and fog. These events may impact airport runwayt capacity, traffic control and ground operations and cause delays. The features in the weather data may be able to be used to predict delays at airports.\n\n#### Precipitation\n\nThe feature 'HourlyPrecipitation' contains the values of liquid precipitation observation values given in inches to hundredths. Traces amounts are reported as T. Null or blank values indicate no precipittion was observed. We replaced all the null values and \"T\" values with zero.  values with \"S\" indicate suspect values. These values accout for only 0.1 percent of the data. Some of these suspect values correspond to very high amounts of precipitation per hour recorded, exceding 9 inches of rain per hour. These extreme events may be anomalies in the data or correspond to rare meteorological events. Overall 92 percent of the values in the \"HourlyPrecipitation\" feature are zero. We retain this feature because the amount of precipitation is likely related to weather delays at airports. Having such a large percentage of zeroes is expected since not all locations get rain every month or season.\n\n#### Temperature\n\nThe weather data set contains three features for temperature observations, wet bulb, dry bulb, and dew point temperature. The difference between wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures is a measure of the humidity of the air. The higher the difference in these temperatures, the lower the humidity. The dew point is the temperature under which water vapor condenses. The higher the dew point, the higher the moisture in the air. Figure 1 shows a statistical summary of the three temperature features. The units of temperature are in degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n**Figure 1 Statistical summary temperature features** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OHDGBSTRSLTifw6dsi3zY0VC1aZQ8UI4\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of the yearly and daily variation of the temperature. The left panel shows the seasonal variation of the reported temperatures reported by the Dallas-Fort Worth airport (DFW). The right panel shows the hourly variation of the temperature at this airport during a day (7-4-2015).  Changes in temperature may be indicative of weather events such as cold fronds, storms that may impact airport operations and cause delays.\n\n**Figure 2 Daily and average temperatures reported by the DFW airport weather station** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=10jnC7A3wUc2-Mt-XI8ync9qq5p21iLT2\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n#### Pressure\n\nFigure 2 shows a statistical summary of the pressure features in the data set. The 'HourlyStationPressure' is the atmospheric pressure observed at the station and reported in inches of Mercury (in Hg). This feature has 2 percent of missing values. The range of values seems reasonable, with the lowest pressure reported approximately 9 psi, corresponding to higher altitude stations or weather events. \n\nThe 'HourlyPressureTendency' indicates increases or decreases in pressure over the 3 previous hours. The 'HourlyPressureChange' indicates a difference in pressure over the past 3 hours. Rapid drops in atmospheric pressure measurements are associated with cloudy, rainy, or windy weather, while rapid increases are associated with clear skies. This feature could be valuable for our model however 77 percent of the values for these features are missing and they will not be introduced in our model. However we can estimate a similar feature using the 'HourlyStationPressure' to estimate the change of pressure over time and introduce that in the model.\n\n**Figure 2 Statistical summary pressure features** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1MohYdajBcUxgvEp3bysRt4Vf91hhnQoh\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n#### Wind\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show the statistical summary of the wind-related features in the data set. Strong surface winds, such as crosswinds and gusts, can impact aircraft coming to land or takeoff, causing disruptions to airport operations. While operations depend on runway length and aircraft size, in general crosswinds in excess of 30-35 kts (about 34-40 mph) are generally prohibitive of take-off and landing.\n\n\nSome anomalous high wind speed values were removed, and most observations are less than ten mph winds. The most significant frequency for wind direction was less than 36 degrees. \n\n**Table 3  Statistical summary of wind features** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DJnTI3BgsOELhKR6x5X946vz-sADELKf\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=50%/>\n\nTo review the relationship of wind direction with delays we reviewed the distribution of the wind direction at airports. Figure 3 shows an example of the distribution of the winds reported at the DFW airport during 2015 and the runway configuration of this airport. The runway configuration was built considering the prevailing winds, to reduce the impacts of crosswinds on the runways which can cause delays. This indicates that to use the wind direction as a feature that can cause flight delays, the individual airport configurations must be considered. In Figure 3, we can observe that the runwas are placed in an orientation compatible with the prevailing winds. The only wind directions that may affect airport operations occurr at a very low frequency  (45 and 90 degrees)\n\n**Figure 3 Distribution of wind direction at DFW airport and runway configuration** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KqxAnLtgkY2vLUVa6dt7PzIoNu-AIoI7\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\nFigure 4 shows a similar situation with LGA airport. In the figure we can see that the orientation of the runways at this airport is compatible with the prevailing winds in the area. The perpendicular runways at this airport leverage the direction of the prevailing winds, therefore the wind direction impact is lower.  From this review we believe that we can use the wind direction as a feature indicating when there are significant crosswinds at the airport. We can obtain runway orientation information for the US airports and attempt to use it as a feature in our model.\n\n**Figure 4 Distribution of wind direction at LGA airport and runway configuration** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1GUv1Oab2HMh_fbNbZ8IWhv_1YDtk7ZQ1\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the hourly wind and wind gusts speeds for the years 2015-2021 in the DFW airport.Since in general crosswinds in excess of about 34-40 mph are restrictive of take-off and landing, the use of these two features in adddition with the wind orientation may have explanatory power for some delays related to weather.\n\n**Figure 5 Distribution of wind and wind gust speeds at DFW airport** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11EYqpIVCPTCtsftH-7XvHFmpZVN6xe9Y\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n#### Visibility\n\nFigure 5 shows the statistical summary of the visibility feature. For meteorology, this is the horizontal distance an object can be seen and identified in whole miles. The aviation industry uses visibility from the control tower and the pilots' visibility by looking at the runway markings. Weather changes that affect visibility in the control tower or runway will lead to disruption in airport operations, delays, or cancellations. There are some anomalous high values of visibility in the dataset, but most values are around 10 miles. These values were removed. The relationship between visibility and flight delays is complex. The systems required to support landing and take off operations under low visility depend on the airport. The ability to operate under restricted visibility such as fog also depends on the instrument rating of the pilot. In general commercial airlines in the US operate under regulations that may require a minimum of 1 mile visibility for two engine planes and  0.5 mile visibility for three ore more engines. These minimums for take-off are useful information to use this feature in our model to explain weather-related delays.\n\n**Table 4 Statistical summary of visibility features** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1S63BF8CBQVmLeQyPK5Nr5Le4Ily1Wghy\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n\nFigures 6 and 7 show panels overlaying certain weather features and the delays caused by weather as indicated by the flight database.\nFrom these examples we can see the correlation between weather events  weather delays. In this case snow and precipitation in the Boston and Dallas airports during 2019. The bottom panel in both figures shows the percentage of flights delays caused by weather, while the panels above show the relevant weather feature that preceded the delays.\n\n**Figure 6 Distribution of weather features and delays at DFW airport** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11u1-6D8ZPpg3M1Zg0ueIeXOZSmR6fuN-\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\n**Figure 7 Distribution of weather features and delays at Boston airport** \\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TknPdnYAbYIYtJ-KWC7nOb6wJwVhsLsO\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=70%/>\n\nFigure 8 shows the distribution of entries per station in a 3 month period. If a station reports their data once every hour, they should have about 2160 entries in the dataset, which is clearly not the case for the majority of the stations. A lot of them seem to report their data every 20 minutes, which is why there're a lot of stations in the 6300 - 6750 bucket. There's also a not insignificant number of stations that seem to report their data every 5 minutes. There're also a lot of stations who report with a lower frequency that once an hour on average. This may pose a challenge when deciding how to join the weather data to the flight data, as some stations may not have recent enough data, and it may not be uniform across all flights\n\n**Figure 6 Reporting Frequency by Station**\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1G_ZWaStDVjX1r6aa2KHMbwfOB0WJBenY\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=40%/>\n\nFigure 9 shows the pearson correlation between the previously discussed variables. As expected, all 3 temperature measurements, despite their differences, are highly positively correlated, which likely means that including more than one of them will not provide the model with more information. Humidity and Visibility also have a relatively high correlation, although negative in this case. As humidity increases, visibility decreases, as it becomes harder to see longer distances.\n\n**Figure 7 Pearson Correlation Matrix for Hourly Weather Data**\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fV7nV_Wao9CCXSQ8KoP30JCbfq2Oh9gY\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=40%/>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"33f53640-0fbc-426a-bdda-555a70ebb955","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Joining the Datasets\n\nTo join the flights and weather data, we need to figure out the closest weather station to a given airport through minimizing distance. One of the datasets provided includes information about each station and their proximity to other neighboring stations that have ICAO codes, this includes the distance to them. We noticed that a lot of these showed a disance of 0, which meant that the station was actually inside the airport.\n\nIn order to assess whether the airports in our flights dataset had a station inside them we had to join them with the station dataset. However the flights dataset only included the IATA code, and not the ICAO code. This meant that we needed an external dataset to join these. For our initial pipeline we used the dataset provided by the [Python Package index](https://pypi.org/project/airportsdata/) which not only provided both IATA and ICAO codes, but also the respective timezones for each airport which will be needed for the join between flight and weather data.\n\nWe then obtained all 388 airports in the flights dataset, by selecting the ORIGIN column and finding the distinct values within in. We then joined it with the external airport dataset to add the ICAO code. At the same time, we grouped all stations by nearest neighbour ICAO code, and found the station with the minimum distance for each of them. We then merged the closest station with the 388 airports and we found that 381 of those airports had a station with weather reports inside of them.\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1XbOJyf5XzmQJcF2PEvYM-50rgJ5qVUQX\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=50%/>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"6c545fc0-88a0-4e7d-aec2-9f6607c1eebd","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Splitting the data and cross validation\n\nGiven that we are dealing with a time series we can't just randomly assign the data to either the training or test set.\n\nEvery flight from 2021 will be assigned to the blind test set, which will only be used for the final evaluation of the model.\n\nThe rest of the flights (2015 to 2020) will be used for the training set. We will conduct cross validation by implementing a blocking split. The 6 year period will be divided into 5 parts, each of 14 months, with the last one consisting of 12. Each of those parts will be split into two, the first 12 months will be used for training while the remaining 2 will be the dev set. By having the last 2 months of the year in the dev set we will avoid any data leakage.\n\nThe results of these models will be combined into a weighted average, which will be used to tune the model's hyperparameters until we find a model with satisfying results. \n\n```\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import col, monotonically_increasing_id\n\ntrain_set =

Weather features\n\nWe introduced categorical features to introduce the present of weather events that may explain certain flight delays. The categorical features indicate the presence of weather related to flight delays such as thunderstorms, snow, fog and ice. \n\n###Previous Flight Delay\n\nAirlines have a finite number of aircrafts, so each aircraft has a route that it follows every day, going from airport to airport. An aircraft being delayed in one airport likely means it will arrive late at its destination, and that may impact that aircraft's next flight's departure time.\n\nIn order to add this feature to our models, we utilized the Window object, partioned by Tail Number (the aircraft ID), andordered it by departure time. Each flight then had the previous delay for the previous flight for its aircraft added as a feature. After an initial analysis, we saw that this had a relatively high correlation (> 0.3) with the current's flight delay.\n\n\n###PageRank Features\nWe were interested in a feature that can indicate the importance or influence of an airport and its role in propagating delays to other flights. Since the US airlines operate in a hub-and-spoke system, some airports play the role of hubs and are critical points of connection for passengers traveling to other airports. Therefore, we modeled the flight data as a directed graph and used the PageRank algorithm to rank the airports considering their connectivity to other airports.\n\nThe PageRank score indicates the airport's importance in the network and its influence on the propagation of delays. We estimated PageRank scores quarterly and applied the results to the next quarter. We reused the functions for graph initialization and PageRank from Homeworks 5. To use these functions, we converted the flight data into an RDD in the appropriate format using the number of flights between airports as weights. Finally, we used the PageRank algorithm with a teleportation probability of 0.01 and a maximum number of iterations of 20. We introduced the PageRank features as a continuous variable for the origin and destination airports for every flight in the dataset. Figure 1 shows the PageRank for the top ten airports for the period 2015-2021. From this calculation we can identify the most important airports in terms of their connectivity, with the major hubs Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD) ranked in the top. The black vertical line indicates the start of the COVID-19 pandemic travel disruption. During this period, airlines drastically reduced the number of commercial flights. From the figure it appears that the disruption affected the connectivity of the hubs, as Dallas DFW and Denver DEN increased their PageRank during this disruption.  \n\nFigure 1 PageRank for the airports\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1EcsjU8V7laoaKIsps-pjSoRwzCC7-imL\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=60%/>\n\n###Delay States of the US airport network\n\nWe identified in the litearure, a feature to capture the overall delay conditions of the network. The delay state represents the network's delay patterns at a point in time. The delay state is defined as the median delay in every origin-destination at every hour. These delay states form clusters around certain times and destinations and can be used as a feature in our model. \nWe estimated the clusters of delay states using the K Means clustering algorithm over a period of time.\nWe selected 5 clusters every year after reviewing the metrics for the K Means algorithm. We calculated the delay states for each year from 2015-2020 using only the data available in the training set. The feature consists of the cluster assignment two hours before the departure time. \nFigure 2 shows the clusters of pattern delays in 2015, from the lowest to the highest delays in the network. We can see interesting patterns, for example, in the cluster with the most delayed flights, most  of the these delays are concentrated in flights that involve DFW, ORD and LAX.\n\nFigure 1 Delay State for Airline network in 2015\n\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HEcklSgn9NpSrO2IvxOUbv8onLq5GyF6\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=60%/>\n\n###Airport capacity features\n\nAccording to the literature, there is a correlation between the number of delayed connecting flights and the total number of flights out of an airport. From this study we introduced three indicator variables defined as follows: \n\nThe crowdedness of the airport is defined as the number of scheduled flights and flights that depart from the airport i at the interval \\\\(\\Delta t \\\\) :\\\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1evseP-HJKL2lCSr1QbVKgjJnJwnUyHC7\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=10%/> \n\nwhere  \\\\(f_i\\\\) and \\\\(f_i^s\\\\) represent the number of actual and scheduled flights at airport \\\\(i\\\\) in a time interval \\\\( [t - \\Delta t, t]\\\\) where t is the departure time  and \\\\(\\Delta t = \\{1h, 2h, ..., 12h}\\\\) \n\n\nTHe ratio of actual flights over scheduled flights out of an airport  \\\\(i\\\\) at the interval  \\\\(\\Delta t \\\\) \\:\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kFnq9LGUrc_isZJOTIeUzUk_BwmRZxAy\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=10%/>\n\nAnd the overall number of flights in the network at the interval  \\\\(\\Delta t \\\\) \\:\n<img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xS_kzQ-5yhybe_T3bHur82iK1KKRqpik\" alt=\"Google Drive Image\" width=10%/>\n\nThese features were introduced in the model as continous variables. We considered All the flights departing at an airport at a given hour are assigned the same values for these features. Since there are no scheduled operations betwen 11 pm and 5 am in most airports, those flights would not have a valid value for the ratio of actual over scheduled flights. The feature most affected by these"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"ee1c9b38-a561-4f8b-a143-816a9e916992","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####SMOTE\n\nWe attempted to add SMOTE as an sampling technique to support our downsampling i.e. reducing the number of non-delayed flights to match the number of delayed flights, but could not get the code working because the code would take too long to run on the full dataset (due to the computationally intensive nature of KNN) The reason we explored SMOTE and other sampling techniques is because the minority class i.e. the 20% of flights that are delayed can have an adverse effect on our models. We decided to utilize \"down sampling\" - sampling from the majority class to address class imbalances issues with flight delays. In fact, when we ran our models on an undersampled dataset, we saw a large lift in recall performance. \n\nIn SMOTE, the synthetic data points are added using a k-nearest neighbors approach with numerical features (KNN). Once we have synthetic numerical features, we can convert the rows into the original dataframe format for our final augmented final dataset where there is a 50/50 split between delayed and non-delayed flights.

AUC stands for area under the curve and ROC stands for receiver operator characteristic. ROC represents a probability curve plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate. In other words, the ROC curve represents the proportion of signal relative to noise. Each point in the ROC curve is a proportion of the true positive rate to the false positive rate at a given classification threshold. When the threshold decreases, more items are classified as positive, increasing the true and false positive rates and hence the monotonically increasing shape of the curve. Similarly, AUC is a summary of ROC and is tell how well the model is able to distinguish between the negative and positive classes. AUC is the the integral from (1,1) to (0,0) where the maximum area is 1, meaning the model can perfectly distinguish between positive and negative cases. An AUC of 0 means that the model gets all cases wrong. When AUC is above 0.5, the model is more likely to be able to differentiate between positive and negative points and ideally we want an AUC close to 1. \n\nThere are two main benefits with using AUC. One is that this measure is scale invariant meaning, the absolute value of the data points doesn't matter because AUC looks at how the predictions are ranked. Second, AUC is threshold invariant, meaning it doesn't matter what classification threshold we pick because the area under the curve gets the overall ability of the model to separate positives from negatives. \n\nNote: The visual above is outdated and is for illustration purposes. We will update the chart at a later date."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"e323e24b-a0a8-4177-8c2f-8fdbea72f440","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Section 4: Hyperparameter Tuning"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"14a295b5-ec43-40ca-a2ae-f2622d074f9e","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["For our decision tree models, we focused primarily on two hyperparameters: max depth of the trees and max number of bins. Max depth indicates when the model stops splitting. Max number of bins is the number of bins used in discretizing continuous, numerical features. With a higher max depth are expressive in capturing outcomes and have potentially higher performance (in F2, accuracy, etc.), but run the risk of overfitting and taking too long to run. Having too many max bins has a similar tradeoff, wherein more bins allow for more granular split decisions, but can be computationally expensive. \n\nWhile not directly related to hyperparameter tuning, we've now realized that we may have too many features and will reduce the number of features in newer models. In addition, we will consider different types of impurity measures to decide splits like Gini and Entropy for decision trees. Similarly, we'll continue to tune the hyperparameters by validating results on other test data to prevent overfitting. In our decision trees, we used a max depth of 10 and max bins of 350. \n\nRandom forests had an additional hyperparameter for the number of decision trees in the random forest. \n\nGradient boosted trees have similar hyperparameters with the addition of maxiter and stepsize. The former refers to the max number of iterations of gradient boosting and latter refers to the learning rate of the model. When the max number of iterations is too high, the model runs the risk of overfitting. To avoid overfitting, we will monitor the error between prediction and validation data. Step sizes less than .1 allow for better generalization, but this becomes computationally expensive. \n\nOur approach to hyperparameter tuning involves grid search and using F2 score as the scoring mechanism. The grid search method involves creating a \"grid\" among hyperparameters to be tuned and evaluating the F2 score for each combination in the grid. Evaluating the hyperparameter combinations requires cross validation hence the name GridSearchCV. The output of hyperparameter tuning would be the optimal F2 score along with the hyperparameter values needed to achieve the highest score. Other techniques include random search though this is employed in discovery and can be a time intensive process. We plan on implementing grid search to tune our hyperparameters as an immediate next step."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"7115361d-3ac2-4614-b999-63ccdb367649","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Section 5: Modeling Pipelines"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"ba80a8f6-9d63-49c7-b9f6-2380a6262d42","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["####Families of input features and count per family\n\nexperiment 1:\nflight_features_cont = ['DISTANCE', 'PREV_DEP_DELAY', 'CRS_DEP_TIME', 'CRS_ARR_TIME']\nairport_capacity_cont = []\npage_rank_cont = ['PageRank_origin','PageRank_dest']\nflight_features_cat = [\"DAY_OF_MONTH\",]\ngraph_features_cat = []\nweather_features_cont = ['ORIGIN_HourlyPrecipitation',\n                         'ORIGIN_HourlyStationPressure',\n                         'ORIGIN_HourlyWindDirection',\n                         'ORIGIN_HourlyWindSpeed',\n                         'ORIGIN_HourlyDryBulbTemperature',\n                         'ORIGIN_HourlyVisibility',\n                         'DEST_HourlyPrecipitation',\n                         'DEST_HourlyStationPressure',\n                         'DEST_HourlyWindDirection',\n                         'DEST_HourlyWindSpeed',\n                         'DEST_HourlyDryBulbTemperature',\n                         'DEST_HourlyVisibility',\n                         ]\nweather_features_binary = ['ORIGIN_TS',\n                           'ORIGIN_ICE',\n                           'ORIGIN_SNOW',\n                           'ORIGIN_FOG',\n                           'DEST_TS',\n                           'DEST_ICE',\n                           'DEST_SNOW',\n                           'DEST_FOG']             \n\nIn our modeling pipelines, we tried to write as many reusable functions as we could to make configuring and tweaking our models easier.

The effect seems small but is consistent across all the models. We were expecting a more noticeable impact when dropping the weather features. Since modern airports are equipped to handle most weather events, only infrequent weather events of a large magnitude can cause flight delays, reducing the importance of these features in the model. \n\nIt is also the case that extreme weather's impact on flight delays affects all the flights scheduled to depart from an airport at that time. Therefore, the flight delays caused by these events are information already captured by other features related to airport capacity. Thus, the addition of weather features may not improve the model's performance since the graph and airport capacity features may already contain this information indirectly.\n\nWe ran the models train and test for the entire dataset in approximately 12 minutes each.

The primary requirements to construct this model require feature engineering, feature selection and building a modeling pipeline to evaluate the perofmance of the model against a baseline model.\n\nFor Phase 3 we conducted the following tasks:\n* We built a modeling pipeline to evalate the performance of different models.The model pipeline implements downsampling to handle the unbalance of the different classes in the data set.
