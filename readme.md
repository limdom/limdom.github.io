I am a Manager of Financial Planning and Analysis (Corporate Finance) at a Alternative Asset Manager. With 10+ years of private equity and mezzanine domain experience, I built my career at the intersection of business judgment, analytics, and programming. 


As an aspiring data scientist and data engineer, I am currently pursuing a Master of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. This branch of the repository makes up the portfolio of projects from the program.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach me limdo@berkeley.edu.
