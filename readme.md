This is an on-going compilation of data science projects to demonstrate my proficiency with data science tools and methodologies across varied datasets. As the majority of my data science projects are associated with the UC Berkeley MIDS program, I created a seperate branch called projects to prevent other students from copying my work. Please switch to the projects branch to view my work.
