I am a Manager of Financial Planning and Analysis (Corporate Finance) at a Alternative Asset Manager. With 10+ years of private equity and mezzanine domain experience, I built my career at the intersection of business judgment, analytics, and programming. 


As an aspiring data scientist and data engineer, I am currently pursuing a Master of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. This branch of the repository makes up the portfolio of projects from the program.
